"""
This is a SCRIPT that addresses two questions raised by Scott Wolk:

1. What are the variability properties in our data of previously known 
   YSOs, divided (by either/both X-ray or IR data) into CI, CII, 
   CIII categories,

and 

2. What do period distributions look like for disked, not-disked, and 
   extreme NIR color categories?

"""

# Let's do question two first.

# so... disk selection works like this:
# if 
#    (J-H) > 1.714*(H-K) 
# then it's a "photosphere"
# if 
#    (J-H) < 1.714*(H-K) and (J-H) > 1.714*(H-K)-0.614 
# then it's a "disk"
# if
#    (J-H) > 1.714*(H-K)-0.614 
# then it's an "extreme disk".
